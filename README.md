Go code developed for a seminar at [University of Bamberg](www.uni-bamberg.de) to illustrate the different concurrency usage and implementation compared to Erlang:

 - general purpose system's programming language
 - statically typed
 - object-oriented
 - compiled 
 - with a concurrent runtime
 - uses a garbage collector
